<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Birthday Paradox</h2>


<p>The birthday problem is a probability paradox in which, given a group of <i>n</i> randomly chosen people, some pair will 
share the same birthday (day and month). Contrary to expectation, only 23 people are required for there to be a 50% probability that two people in the group share a birthday.
This occurs because the shared birthday is not chosen in advance, so the probability of a shared birthday is larger than expected. We can write this probability as:</p>

$$P(x) = 1- {365 * 364 * ... * (365 - n + 1) \over (365^n)} $$

<p>
This means that we reach a 99.9% probability of a shared birthday in a group of around 70 people.
</p> 

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Birthday Attack</h2>

<p>A birthday attack is a special type of brute-force hash collision attack that is possible because of the result
of the result of the birthday problem. Within a hash space, we can find two values that have the same hash in fewer attempts than typically expected.</p> <p> For example, for a 32-bit hash with ~4.2 billion possible values, there is a 50% chance of finding a collision with only ~80,000 attempts.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Finding Collisions with OpenCL</h2>
<p>
Although the probability of finding a hash collision increases when using a Birthday Attack, the process still requires performing a large number of 
hashes and storing the results for comparison later. 
</p>
<p> 
A GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) can be used to expedite this process. GPUs were originally created to allow complex graphics to be
rendered on a screen. Many computer graphics algorithms (e.g. lighting of a 3D scene) require that values be computed for every pixel on the screen.
For any screen with a large resolution (1920x1080 screen has ~2,000,000 pixels) this becomes too large of a task to perform efficiently with a CPU's limited number of threads. 
</p>
<p>
GPUs solve this problem by utilizing a large number of cores. A typical GPU has hundreds to thousands of cores, whereas a typical CPU has 2-8 cores. Each GPU core is individually weaker than a CPU core, but together they
can perform tasks in parallel much faster than they can be computed sequentially on a CPU.
</p>
<p>
Frameworks like OpenCL and CUDA allow GPUs to be used for arbitrary parallel computations. In our project, we use OpenCL
to compute large batches of hash values in parallel. We then compare these hashed values to find collisions. Because we use a comparatively small hash,
we can compute a large number of collisions very quickly. 
</p>
<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Scalability</h2>
<p>
This process of finding hash collsions on a GPU is scalable to larger GPUs, or even clusters of multiple GPUs. These multi GPU setups are commonly used for breaking hash algorithms. Unfortunately,
hash algorithms double in complexity for every bit added, which means that a 64-bit hash is 2<sup>32</sup> times harder to solve than a 32-bit hash. The recent SHA-1 collision from Google required the equivalent of
6500 years of time on a CPU, as well as 110 years on a GPU to solve. This process was still ~100,000 times faster than a brute-force attack. 
</p>
<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hash Visualization</h2>
<p>
For our visualization, we chose to use the FNV-1a hash, which is a lightweight non-cryptographic hash. This hash
is suitable for a demonstration because the hash space is small relative to most popular hashes like MD5 and SHA-256, and it is also computationally light.

A 32-bit hash has $$2^{32} = 4294967296$$ possible values. In our visualization, we break this hash space up into a 16x16 grid, so each grid cell has
$$2^{24} = 16777216$$ possible values. Each time the user presses the button, the program computes 1,000,000 new hash values and inserts them into a table to check for collisions.
As each cell receives collisions, it will change color. The shade of yellow or red represents the density of collisions in this space.
