<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Birthday Attack</h1>

<p>"A birthday attack is a type of cryptographic attack that exploits the mathematics behind the <mark>birthday problem</mark> in probability theory. This attack can be used to abuse communication between two or more parties. The attack depends on the higher likelihood of collisions found between random attack attempts and a fixed degree of permutations (<mark>pigeonholes</mark>). With a birthday attack, it is possible to find a collision of a <mark>hash function</mark> in &radic;2<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>n/2</sup> being the classical preimage resistance security. There is a general (though disputed) result that quantum computers can perform birthday attacks, thus breaking collision resistance, in &#8731;2<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>n/3</sup>." -- Wikipedia</p>

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Birthday Problem</h2>

<p>The birthday problem is a probability paradox in which, given a set of <i>n</i> randomly chosen people, some pair will share the same birthday (day and month). By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays with the inclusion of February 29<sup>th</sup>). However, a probability of 99.9% is met with only 70 people, and a probability of 50% is met with a mere 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29<sup>th</sup>) is equally probable for a birthday.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Pigeonhole Principle</h2>

<p>The pigeonhole principle is an example of a counting argument which states that if <i>n</i> item are put into <i>m</i> containers, with <i>n</i> being larger than <i>m</i>, at least one container must contain more than one item.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hash Collision</h2>

<p>A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Collision</h2>

<p>A collision occurs when two different inputs to a function produce the same output (in this instance, a hash value).</p>
